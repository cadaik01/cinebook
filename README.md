## 🚀 Installation & Usage Guide

### 1. Requirements

To run CineBook locally, you should have:

- PHP version 8.2 or higher  
- Composer for managing PHP dependencies  
- Node.js (version 18 or higher) and npm for the Vite frontend  
- MySQL 8.0 or higher for the database  
- XAMPP or a similar environment to run the web server and database  

### 2. Setup Overview

The typical setup flow is:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine  
2. Create an environment configuration file from the provided example and update your database and app settings  
3. Install backend and frontend dependencies using Composer and npm  
4. Create a MySQL database named `cinebook` and import:
   - The database schema file  
   - The sample data file  
5. Create the storage link so that uploaded files are accessible publicly  
6. Start the Laravel development server and the Vite dev server  
7. Access the application through your browser  

(Concrete commands and configuration details are available inside the original project; this README keeps the instructions at a descriptive level and deliberately does not include code blocks.)

## 🔑 Default Accounts

The system includes sample accounts for testing:

### Admin Account

- Email: `admin@cinebook.com`  
- Password: `123456`  

### User Account

You can log in with these accounts to explore both the customer and admin experiences.

## 📂 Documentation & Structure

The project is organized following standard Laravel conventions, for example:

- **app/**: application logic, including controllers and models  
- **database/**: migrations and seeders for the database  
- **mySQL/**: SQL files for database schema and sample data (such as `mySQL.sql` and `data.sql`)  
- **public/**: compiled CSS, JavaScript utilities, and public images  
- **resources/**: Blade views, source CSS, and JavaScript  
- **routes/**: application routes definition  

You can refer to additional documentation files inside the repository (for example, a separate setup guide) for more in‑depth configuration and extension details.

## 🎯 Core Functionality

### Booking Flow

1. The user selects a movie from the “Now Showing” or “Upcoming” list  
2. The user chooses a showtime based on date, time, and screening room  
3. The user selects seats using an interactive seat map with visual seat states  
4. Once the booking is confirmed, a 10‑minute countdown timer starts  
5. The user completes payment using the configured payment method  
6. On successful payment, the system generates and displays QR codes for the booked seats  

### QR Code System

- Each single seat receives one unique QR code  
- Couple seats or seat pairs can share a single QR code  
- QR codes are used at the cinema entrance for check‑in  
- Ticket status can move between states such as “active”, “checked”, and “cancelled”  

### Countdown Timer

- The countdown starts when the user confirms the booking  
- Each booking session has a duration of 10 minutes  
- The remaining time is preserved so it is not lost when navigating between pages  
- When less than one minute remains, the interface can highlight the warning  
- If time runs out before payment, unpaid bookings are automatically cancelled  

## 🛠 Technologies Used

### Backend

- **Laravel 12** as the main PHP framework  
- **MySQL** as the relational database for movies, showtimes, rooms, tickets, and users  
- A **QR code generation library** integrated into Laravel for ticket QR codes  

### Frontend

- **Vite** as the build tool and development server  
- **Blade Templates** as the main templating engine  
- **JavaScript** for interactive features such as seat selection, countdown timers, and dynamic UI  
- **CSS3** for layout, styling, and visual effects  

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

Common issues and how to approach them:

- Environment configuration problems (for example, missing or incorrect `.env` values such as APP_URL or database settings)  
- Frontend not built or dev server not running  
- Database not created or SQL files not imported  
- MySQL or XAMPP services not started  

When you encounter issues:

1. Double‑check the `.env` file, especially database credentials and application URL  
2. Verify that the MySQL service is running and that the `cinebook` database exists  
3. Confirm that all PHP and Node.js dependencies are installed  
4. Rebuild or restart the development servers as needed
